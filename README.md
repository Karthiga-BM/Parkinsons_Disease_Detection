# Parkinsons_Disease_Detection
In this Python machine learning project, using machine learning algorithm XGBoost, I detect the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease in individuals using various factors. I used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives us an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.
